 I just thought I would like to share these spherical
 quadtree data structures. They are based on a paper
 by Goodchild and Shirena, and the basis for them
 can be found in the Spheres documentation directory here.
 I have not yet added binary encoding.


We now have them plugged into XFILES headers rather than local version.
We have Nicrosoft Windows and Linux versions
